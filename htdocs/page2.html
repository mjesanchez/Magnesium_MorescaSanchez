    <td>The respiratory system is located in the upper body, consisting of multiple parts. The nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm being the main parts, although there are more located within these regions. The respiratory system is connected to the digestive system via the pharynx, although separated by the epiglottis, a flap that prevents food from going inside the lungs. It is also connected to the circulatory system via the lungs through its alveoli. Below are the 5 main parts of the respiratory system.</td>
    <td>The respiratory system is responsible for breathing and exchanging gas through the human body. The respiratory system works in tandem with the circulatory system, providing oxygen gas to every part of the body. It also expells carbon dioxide gas that the circulatory system transports back to the lungs.</td>

    <h2>Nose and Nasal Cavity</h2>
      <!-- box for the description -->
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The nose is, of course, where humans breathe air in and out. It is usually a triangular shape that contains holes at the bottom. The nasal cavity is an area right behind the nose that contains mucus and hairs, the former to keep the nose moist, and the latter to filter out bad stuff in the inhaled air. After the nasal cavity comes the pharynx.</p>

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Pharynx</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The pharynx is not necessarily an organ, but an area of the respiratory system. It is divided into the nasopharynx, laryngopharynx, and the oropharynx. We are only interested in the first two, as the oropharynx is part of the digestive system. The nasopharynx is located right after the nasal cavity and functions as a passageway for air. The laryngopharynx is part of both the respiratory and digestive systems, and contains the larynx, the voicebox, and the epiglottis, a  separator between the esophagus and trachea.</p>

<!-- Organ 3 -->
<div class="organ">
  <img src="../images/trachea.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"  alt="trachea">
  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Trachea</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The trachea is yet another organ that serves as a passageway for air. If the epiglottis mistakenly lets a piece of food or liquid into the trachea, the human usually coughs. In addition to this, the trachea warms and moisturizes the air and catches any other microbes that may have slipped through before the air enters the lungs. The trachea starts right after the voicebox and continues until it separates into 2 bronchi, one for each of the lungs.</p>

<!-- Organ 4 -->
<div class="organ">
  <img src="../images/lung.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"  alt="lung">
  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Lungs</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The lungs are arguably the most important part of the respiratory system. They are responsible for exchanging air with the circulatory system and the rest of the body. After the air enters from the trachea and bronchi, it passes through the bronchioles and then enters the alveoli. The alveoli are the specific points where the circulatory system exchanges gas. When air is inhaled, the oxygen in the alveoli outnumber the oxygen in the blood cells. Diffusion is the process where something moves from a concentrated place to a not concentrated place. Due to diffusion, the oxygen would move from the concentrated place, the alveoli, and go into the blood cells. The inverse also happens for carbon dioxide when humans exhale. The amount of carbon dioxide in the blood cells outnumbers the ones in the alveoli and diffusion happens. This is why inhaling and exhaling are equally distributed. This inhale-exhale motion is due to the last organ, the diaphragm.</p>

<!-- Organ 5 -->
<div class="organ">
  <img src="../images/diaphragm.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"  alt="diaphragm">
  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Diaphragm</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The diaphragm is the bottommost part of the respiratory system, it is responsible for contracting and expanding when you inhale and exhale. By contracting, it pulls air into the lungs, and by expanding, it pushes air out of the lungs, back into the atmosphere.</p>
