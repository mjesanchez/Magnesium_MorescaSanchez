    <td>The circulatory system (also known as the cardiovascular system) is a gigantic pipe network of sorts in your body. It flows all around your body, giving almost every cell access to this vital pipe network. All pipe networks need a pump, and this is the function of the heart, to pressurize the blood in your circulatory system and transport it around. The circulatory system also connects to the kidneys and the lungs, as these serve as vital drop off points for your circulatory system.</td>
    <td>The circulatory system is very important organ system in your body. It facilitates the transportation of many different important nutrients and gases within your body, all of which vital for your body cells to function and survive. It also facilitates the transportation of waste products out of your body, like carbon dioxide out through your lungs, and other waste/harmful products in your body out through the kidneys</td>

    <h2>Heart</h2>
      <!-- box for the description -->
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The heart is the main organ of the circulatory system. It is a muscular organ that pumps blood for the entire body, without it, your cells would have no way to remove or receive the vital nutrients they need to survive. It's connected to the lungs via pulmonary arteries and veins, which the heart pumps in de-oxygenated blood for the lungs to take oxygen from the air and turn it into oxygenated blood, which the heart then takes and transports back to the rest of the body.</p>

    <h2>The Blood</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The blood is the fluid that is pumped all around your body. It is not a regular fluid like water, but is composed of many different things, including white and red blood cells, plasma, different proteins and horomones, and many other immune cells. The blood serves as the vehicle for many different proteins and nutrients required for the body to function ride around in to be transported around. Plasma, which was mentioned earlier, makes up around 50% of blood. It mainly composed of water and contains most of the miscallenous stuff that floats in your blood. The main important part of your blood are the red blood cells, as these cells transport oxygen, which is vital for cells to function.</p>

<section class="organ" id="arteries">

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>The Arteries</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and to other parts of the body. This oxygenated blood is, as the name suggests, rich with oxygen. The arteries have strong walls to handle the pressure the heart makes with each heartbeat. The arteries start with the aorta, the biggest artery in your body, which is also the one closest to the heart. This aorta then splits, splitting the blood to either move to above the chest, or move below the waist. Either way, these arteries eventually split into smaller and smaller arteries till they all reach every part of your body.</p>

<!-- Organ 4 -->
<section class="organ" id="veins">

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>The Veins</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The veins are basically the opposite of arteries, carrying blood back to your heart. Veins, compared to the arteries, don't need thick walls as they don't receive the full pressure of the heart. But due to this, there's a chance the veins might flow in the wrong direction. This is why the veins contain small valves, that keep the flow moving in one direction at all times. The veins start from the capillaries, mentioned below, and end at either the Superior Vena Cava, at the top of the heart, or the Inferior Vena Cava, at the bottom of the heart.</p>

<!-- Organ 5 -->
<section class="organ" id="capillaries">
  <img src="../images/circulatory/capillaries.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"  alt="capillaries">
  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>The Capillaries</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The capillaries complete the tract of your circulatory system, as these microscopic blood vessels connect the arteries to the veins. These tiny capillaries serve as the site where the main exchange of gases and nutrients happen between your cells and the blood. Their walls are made of a single layer of endothelial cells, and tiny gaps in this wall allow for oxygen and nutrients to pass through. Sometimes these walls are bigger or smaller depending on which part of the body they're located in, to facilitate the different nutrients or proteins flowing in and out of that part of the body.</p>
