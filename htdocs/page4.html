    <td>The nervous system is a giant interlocking system of nerves that control the human body. It sends and receives electrical signals from the body to allow it to move, and the nerves are the path to which these electrical signals travel on. It is composed of 2 main parts, the Central Nervous System (CNS), encompasses the brain and the spinal cord, and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), which encompasses the Somatic Nervous System (SNS) and the Automatic Nervous System (ANS).</td>
    <td>The nervous system is probably the most important organ system in our body. It is basically the command or overseer of the human body. The nervous system is responsible for allowing us to move, think, and interact with the world, all through the power of nerves, hence the name. It controls every part of the body, and is probably the one allowing us to think and feel.</td>

    <h2>The Brain</h2>
      <!-- box for the description -->
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>Part of the Central Nervous System (CNS) | An organ that controls the entire body, it is probably the most important organ in your body as it is the one that processes information from the world through your senses and into thoughts, feelings, and actions. Each part of your brain has a specific role in your body, like the occipital love, which is reponsible for processing visual signals. It can do this because it is made up of nerves, cells that transmit signals, and we don't know exactly how, but with enough nerves and a specific way these nerves are arranged allows the creation of complex thought and actions. The brain is connected to the rest of your body through your brain stem, which connects directly to the spinal cord.</p>

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Spinal Cord</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>Part of the Central Nervous System (CNS) | The spinal cord acts as the connection between the brain to the rest of the body. It is a long system of nerves that run inside your spine or the vertebral column, and is connected to the peripheral nervous system. The spinal cord can react to certain stimuli in your body, much faster than your brain. This is helpful in reflex actions. When you touch something really hot, instead of the brain reacting to it, the spinal cord can act instead, sending signals to let go of that hot object much faster than your brain.</p>

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Somatic Nervous System (SNS)</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>Part of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) | This part of your nervous system is responsible for relaying the senses from your body to the brain/CNS and the signals from the brain to your body. The Somatic Nervous System (SNS) is responsible for voluntary movement from your brain, mainly being towards controlling muscles in your body. This makes SNS vital for your body moving.</p>

<!-- Organ 4 -->
<section class="organ" id="ANS">
  <img src="../images/nervous/ans.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"  alt="ANS">
  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Automatic Nervous System (ANS)</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>Part of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) | This part of your peripheral nervous system is all about involuntary/unconcious actions, it controls everything, from your heart beating, the blood pressure, your breathing, your digestion, and arousal. Despite you not controlling it, this part of your nervous system is vital, as it controls everything that makes your body function. Imagine manually controlling breathing, blinking, the heart beats, every muscle action involved in sloshing your food around in your intestines. </p>
