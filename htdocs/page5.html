    <td>The urinary system is located within the middle- to lower-torso. It is composed of 4 main organs, namely the kidneys, urethra, ureters, and bladder. The two kidneys in either side of your abdomen are connected to the circulatory system through the renal arteries and renal veins. These kidneys are then connected to the bladder through the ureters. </td>
    <td>The urinary system is the main system that handles the filtration of blood and the eventual excretion of these wastes. The urinary system is vital to keeping your body clean of any harmful waste products that would otherwise just built up in your body and would otherwise poison you. </td>

      <p>The kidneys are bean-shaped organs that have many multiple functions. There are two of them located in either side of your abdomen. Their main purpose is to filter out any waste products from your blood, this is why the circulatory system keeps a pair of veins and arteries just for the kidneys. They also keep the balance of many different substances within your body, removing any excess water or minerals from your body for example, and exrete certain horomones into your body. It filters your body through a system of millions of filters called nephrons. Each nephron is made of 2 parts. The 1st are the glomeruli, tiny clusters of blood vessels that allow filter out any large substances and allow water and other smaller particles to pass through the next stage called the tubule. The tubule consists of a blood vessel around the tubule that reabsorbs the water and other useful particles into the blood, and the remaining waste products get thrown into the bladder as urine.</p>

    <h2>Bladder</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The bladder is an organ located just above your pelvis that stores urine in your body. The bladder changes shape depending on the amount of urine stored within. The walls of the bladder are coated with a mucuos membrane, to help keep your urine sterile when it is within your body. The bladder is there so the body can control when and where it releases your urine. When the body finally decides to pee, controlled by nerves that tell you how full it is, your bladder contracts and flattens to release all the urine out through the urethra and out of the body.</p>

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Ureters</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The ureters are a pair of long small tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The ureter walls are made of 3 layers, the fibrous coat that give the ureters strength, the muscular layer that constantly push urine away from the kidneys, and the innermost layer called the mucosa, that is continuous from the kidney walls to the bladder and which releases mucus to protect the cells.</p>

  <div class="organ_body">
    <h2>Urethra</h2>
    <div class="organ_description">
      <p>The final organ in the urinary system is the urethra. It allows urine to pass from the bladder to outside the body. The walls of the urethra are thin and made of smooth muscle and connective tissue. When the bladder is ordered to expel urine, the muscles of the urethra at the same time are ordered to relax, and open up to let the urine flow out of your body.</p>
